## 🚀 About Me

I’m a second-year Software Engineering student at Ontario Tech University with a strong interest in building practical, user-focused software. I enjoy learning how software systems work end-to-end — from writing clean code to understanding how applications scale, interact, and support real users.

My academic journey has pushed me to develop solid fundamentals in programming, problem-solving, and software design, which I actively reinforce through personal projects and hands-on development outside the classroom. I’m especially interested in accessibility, productivity tools, and creating software that makes everyday tasks easier.
